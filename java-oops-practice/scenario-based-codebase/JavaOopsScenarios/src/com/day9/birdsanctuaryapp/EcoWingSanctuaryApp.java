Bird Sanctuary – Java OOP Scenario

Goal: 
	● Design and implement a Bird Sanctuary system to manage different types of birds, utilizing Inheritance and Polymorphism.

Scenario (Story-Based):
	● You are hired by the EcoWing Wildlife Conservation Center, which runs a Bird Sanctuary to protect and study various birds. 
	● They want to digitize their tracking and behavior management system.

The sanctuary houses a variety of birds, each with different abilities:
	● Some can fly (e.g., Eagle, Sparrow)
	● Some can swim (e.g., Duck, Penguin)
	● Some can both fly and swim (e.g., Seagull)
	● Some can neither (e.g., Kiwi, Ostrich)

Each bird has:
	● A name
	● A species
	● A unique ID
	● Behaviors like eat(), and if applicable, fly(), swim()

Requirements / Problem Statement:
	Design a Java application that fulfills the following:
	1. Use Inheritance:
		● Create a base class Bird with common properties and methods (name, id, species, eat()).
		● Derive classes like Eagle, Duck, Penguin, etc., extending the Bird class.
		● Create interfaces: Flyable, Swimmable – with abstract methods fly() and swim() respectively.
		● Implement these interfaces in relevant bird classes.
	
	2. Use Polymorphism:
		● Maintain a list of all birds in the sanctuary.
		● Use a loop to call fly() or swim() polymorphically only for birds that implement those behaviors.
	
	3. Functionality to Implement:
		●  Add new birds to the sanctuary
		●  Search birds by flying/swimming ability
		●   Display all birds with their full information and abilities
		● ️ Remove a bird by ID
		●  Show a report that counts how many birds are Flyable, Swimmable, Both, or Neither
	
Technical Constraints:
	● Use Java Inheritance and Interfaces
	● Use Polymorphism for invoking fly/swim/eat methods
	● Use ArrayList<Bird> or Map<String, Bird> to store bird records
	● Follow good OOP practices: encapsulation, clean code, modular design Stretch Goals (Optional):
	● Save and load bird data from a file (using serialization)
	● Add age, health status, or feeding schedule
	● Track last feeding time or behavior logs
	                         
Example Output (CLI):
	Welcome to EcoWing Bird Sanctuary
	1. Add Bird
	2. Display All Birds
	3. Display All Flying Birds
	4. Display All Swimming Birds
	5. Display Both Flying & Swimming Birds
	6. Delete Bird by ID
	7. Sanctuary Report
	8. Exit
