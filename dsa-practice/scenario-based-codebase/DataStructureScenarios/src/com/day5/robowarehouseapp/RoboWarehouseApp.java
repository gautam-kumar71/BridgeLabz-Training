/*
6. RoboWarehouse – Shelf Loading Robot (Insertion Sort)
Story: 
	● A robot loads packages onto shelves based on weight. 
	● It adds one package at a time and must maintain an ascending order by weight for balance. 
	● Insertion Sort helps since new items are inserted into the sorted list dynamically.
Key Concepts:
	● Insertion into sorted lists
	● Low memory footprint
	● Ideal for streaming insertions
