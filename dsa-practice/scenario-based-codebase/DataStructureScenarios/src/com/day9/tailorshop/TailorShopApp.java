/*
9. TailorShop – Sorting Orders by Delivery Deadline (Insertion Sort)
Story: At a tailor’s shop, new clothing orders are received every hour. Each order has a
deadline, and the owner maintains a sorted list of orders by delivery date. Since each new
order is inserted into a nearly sorted list, Insertion Sort is simple and fast.
Concepts Involved:
● Insertion Sort
● Real-time updates
● Deadline-based sorting
