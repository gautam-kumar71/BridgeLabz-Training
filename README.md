### 🗓 Day 15 – Linked List

**(Date: 02-Jan-2026)**

* Studied Linked List and its basic concept

  * `Node structure` (data + next reference)
  * `Dynamic memory` allocation
* Types of Linked Lists:

  * `Singly` Linked List
  * `Doubly` Linked List
  * `Circular` Linked List
* Operations performed on Linked List:

  * `Insertion` (beginning, end, position)
  * `Deletion` (by value / position)
  * `Traversal`
  * `Searching elements`
* Advantages and limitations of Linked List

  * Dynamic size
  * No direct access, sequential traversal
* Implemented Linked List programs in Java
* Committed and pushed all work

### 🗓 Day 16 – Stacks, Queues, HashMap & Hash Functions

**(Date: 03-Jan-2026)**

* Studied `Stack` (LIFO) and `Queue` (FIFO) concepts.
* Learned basic operations: `push`, `pop`, `peek`, `offer`, `poll`.
* Implemented stack problems and queue problems.
* Studied HashMap and hashing basics (`put`, `get`, collisions).
* Implemented HashMap and hash function concepts.
* Committed and pushed all work.
