### 🗓 Day 15 – Linked List

**(Date: 02-Jan-2026)**

* Studied Linked List and its basic concept

  * `Node structure` (data + next reference)
  * `Dynamic memory` allocation
* Types of Linked Lists:

  * `Singly` Linked List
  * `Doubly` Linked List
  * `Circular` Linked List
* Operations performed on Linked List:

  * `Insertion` (beginning, end, position)
  * `Deletion` (by value / position)
  * `Traversal`
  * `Searching elements`
* Advantages and limitations of Linked List

  * Dynamic size
  * No direct access, sequential traversal
* Implemented Linked List programs in Java
* Committed and pushed all work
