```
- Learned Java Generics for type-safe and reusable collection handling.
- Understood Type Parameters (`T`, `E`, `K`, `V`) and their role in APIs.
- Implemented Generic Classes and Generic Methods.
- Used Bounded Types (`extends`, `super`) to restrict and control types.
- Applied Wildcards (`?`, `? extends`, `? super`) for flexible collections.
- Followed Generics best practices (no raw types, safe bounds, readable design)
